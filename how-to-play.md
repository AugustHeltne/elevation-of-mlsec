# How to play

## Rules
Draw a diagram of the system that you threat model / risk analyze before dealing cards. Play like “Spades”, where everyone must play in the same suit or call pass, and the highest “bidder” takes the trick and may start the next round. In Elevation of MLsec, cards in the Dataset risk suit are trump. Use a diagram / model of an ML system, ML lifecycle or a system with an ML component. The player should be able to explain how the risk relates to the model. In case of an argument, when something is not clear from the diagram, the player may make the necessary assumptions about the system to call a risk, or the team may agree upon a playbook for their system.

The ace of each suit is an open risk card. When a ace is played, the player must identify a risk not listed on another card. To help with this, see the summary cards in the back of the deck.

**Points:** 1 for a threat on your card, +1 for taking the trick.

When all the cards have been played, whoever has the most points wins. Don’t forget to triage the threats you discovered, and lastly remember to have fun.

## Setup cheatsheet
(Taken from https://github.com/adamshostack/eop/blob/master/cheatsheet.md) 

1. Draw a system model where everyone can see it, for example on a whiteboard or on a large screen.
2. Ask everyone to set aside skepticism for 15 minutes.
3. Setup details
    - Goal: Win hands by connecting the threat on the card to the system and playing the highest card.
    - Play in small groups (3-6 people), using one deck per group.  Remove the front cards (instructions, strategy) and the back (lists of threats), so you only have threat cards, and shuffle those. Deal the whole deck to the players.
    - Determine the first player based on who has the lowest card of Input risks. Players following have to play the same suit.
4. Play!
    - Make sure people take notes on the threats
    - Some people will play collaboratively with their hands face up in front of them, others competitively, with cards close to their chest. Choose the approach that you wish.
