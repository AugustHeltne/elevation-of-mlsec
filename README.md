# Elevation of MLsec
Elevation of MLsec is an unofficial Machine Learning Security (MLsec) extension of Microsoft's Elevation of Privilege threat modeling card game. These playing cards portray risks associated with Machine Learning systems that have been identified by research groups. It is suitable to play this game with or without the original Elevation of Privilege deck depending on the nature of what you're threat modeling.

## Source material

This work is mainly based on Berryville Institute for Machine Learnings (BIML)’s architectural risk analysis for machine learning systems (BIML-78) and their LLM analysis (BIML-LLM24), found on [berryvilleiml.com](https://berryvilleiml.com). We have also added a few somewhat supplementary LLM specific threats from OWASP’s TOP 10 list for Large Language Model Applications found on [owasp.org](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/). To anyone curious about how the risk frameworks are mapped to our cards and applied in this game, please check out [risk-frameworks.md](./ml-risk-frameworks/risk-frameworks.md) and [cards.yaml](cards.yaml). Please note that this game is *not* a comprehensive representation of the risks frameworks, and to get a "full" coverage we recommend bringing the frameworks along to threat modeling sessions. The source material is found in the [ml-risk-frameworks](./ml-risk-frameworks/) folder.
