# Elevation of MLsec
Elevation of MLsec is an unofficial Machine Learning Security (MLsec) extension of Microsoft's Elevation of Privilege threat modeling card game. These playing cards portray risks associated with Machine Learning systems that have been identified by research groups. You may play this game with or without the original Elevation of Privilege deck.

This work is mainly based on Berryville Institute for Machine Learnings (BIML)’s architectural risk analysis for machine learning systems (BIML-78): [berryvilleiml.com](https://berryvilleiml.com) and their LLM analysis (BIML-LLM24). We have also added a few somewhat supplementary LLM specific threats from OWASP’s TOP 10 list for Large Language Models found on [owasp.org](https://owasp.org). Cards are referencing their risk origin in the aforementioned frameworks. Risks originating from BIML’s ML risk analysis for ML are tagged with \[\<component label\>:\<risk number\>:\<descriptor>\]. Risks originating from the BIML Architectural Risk Analysis of LLMs are tagged with \[LLM:\<component label\>:\<risk number\>:\<descriptor\>\]. Risks from OWASP are tagged with \[OWASP-\<project\>-\<number\>\], so for LLMs it’s \[OWASP-LLM-\<number\>\]. 

Card templates are inspired by the Elevation of Privilege card game ([https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20303](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20303)), which is © 2010 Microsoft Corporation, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States license ([https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/)).
